# Gilded Rose with Automated refactorings

## Description:
This kata has a legacy code to practice the automated refactor using the IDE.
We have a Golden Master test harness to ensure that the refactoring that we are doing does not change the behaviour.

## Goals:
- Discover / improve our automated refactorings skills that an IDE can
provide us.
- Refactor as tool to understand the business logic.
- Understand the benefits of having a test harness.
