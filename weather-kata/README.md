# Weather kata
We cannot control the weather, but we can predict it.

This kata has a code that request the weather prediction from an external API.

## Goal
- Test coupled code.
- Remove the external dependency when testing in order to make the tests repeatable and fast

## How to run the kata
Use _make_ or open [Makefile](./Makefile) and copy the commands.
