# Gilded Rose characterization testing

## Description:
This kata has a legacy code to practice writing unit tests and characterization tests.

There is an example test to simplify writing the first test.

You can to run the test with coverage in order to know if all the paths have been executed.

You can to run [PIT mutation testing](http://pitest.org/) in order to know if all the boundaries have been ensured.

# Business requirements
- At the end of each day items lowers quality and sellIn by one
- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- The Quality of an item is never negative
- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets instead of decreasing
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
- "Sulfuras" never has to be sold nor decreases in Quality (quality and sellIn does not change)
- "Backstage passes": We donâ€™t know the requirements :(

## Goals:
- Write unit tests that validate the business requirements
- Use the characterization test technique and code coverage to identify the Backstage passes requirements and try to reach 100% coverage.
- As code coverage is not enough, use mutation testing to find extra requirements writing new tests.

## How to run and see the result
## Locally
### on Linux and Mac
Run the tests

    make tests

Run the code coverage

    make coverage

Mutation

    You can install Pitest in either Eclipse (Pitclipse) and IntellyJ (PITEst)
    
     https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pitclipse
     
     https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7119-pit-mutation-testing-idea-plugin
or

    make mutation

    
### on Windows
Open the Makefile and copy and paste the lines below each command.
	
## Docker

### on Linux and Mac
Generate the image

    make docker-build

Run the tests
    
    make docker-tests

Run the code coverage
    
    make docker-coverage

How to run mutation testing:

    make docker-mutation

### on Windows
Open the Makefile and copy and paste the lines below each command.
