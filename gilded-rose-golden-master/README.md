# Gilded Rose Golden Master

## Description:
This is a legacy code kata simulates that implements the xx.

The code is small but it has a lot of code smells and sometimes it's difficult to understand.
 
## Goals:
- Write a code to generate an output that you need to be sure the code behaviour does not change.
- Write an script to automate the test execution.
