# Gilded Rose Golden master

## Description:
This kata has a legacy code to practice writing a Golden Master piece.

# Business requirements
You don't need the business requirements.

## Goals:
- Write a code to generate an output that you need to be sure the code behaviour does not change.
- Write an script to automate the test execution.

## How to run the kata
Use _make_ or open [Makefile](./Makefile) and copy the commands.
